## The first step
### Variables
Is a place in memory that we use to store data inside it, there is different type of variable in java like :   
1-	Instance Variables: it defines without using static keyword because their values are unique to each instance of a class.   
2-	Class Variables:  we add static keyword when create to make them accessible in the whole class.    
3-	Local Variables: those variable that we are create inside method or code block { } and we can’t access them outside they only work locally.    
4-	 Parameters : it is the variable of the methods that we create like :
public static void main(String [] args) => args here is the variable of main method.  

Naming: set of rules and conventions for that we are use  to  name our (classes,variables,methods)  like:   
1-	The first letter of main must be small letter or start $ symbol or _    
2-	The white space between the name is not allowed    
3-	We can’t use reserved words as names    
4-	We can’t start the name  with number    

### Operators :
Is a symbol’s that usually represent an action or process. These symbols were adopted to :

### Control flow statements
We use them to control our data and how it will appear, there is different type of control flow statement like :   
1-	Looping   (for,while,do while)   
2-	Decision (if-then,if-then-else,nested if,ternary,switch)   
3-	Branch inside statement (break,continue,return)
