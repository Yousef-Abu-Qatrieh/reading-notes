## CLass And Object   
A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.  
Object have two major characteristics that models the state and behavior of a real-world object.   
Software object are fundamental part of object oriented very similar to real life object they consist of:   
1- state 
2- behavior  
Software object store it states in fields which is known as (variables) and expose behavior with methods    
## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers  
The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:   
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9     

Binary Numbers are just "Base 2". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.

Hexadecimal numbers  There are 16 of them. They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.    
So a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10 like this:
