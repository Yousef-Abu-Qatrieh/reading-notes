# Motivation (don't give up yes i can do it )

To become a good developer, I should practice and enhance my way in write code  
You should put goal, dream to run after it never say I canâ€™t you can by hard work 
Improving my technical skills makes the software build in better way
Work with team make my work finish in better way
